Classify the WhatsApp message below as “scam”, “maybe_scam”, or “not_scam”.
Return a confidence score (0.00–1.00), a short reason, and an action suggestion.`;

}

### Notes & Constraints
1. Risk-score calibration  
   – Start from your own internal probability.  
   – Add score_boost (already capped) and clip max to 1.00.  
   – Map final score → label:  
       • ≥ 0.80 ⇒ scam  
       • 0.40–0.79 ⇒ maybe_scam  
       • < 0.40 ⇒ not_scam.
2. Keep *reason* and *suggestion* in English.
3. Output exactly and only the JSON object—no extra keys, comments, or new-lines.
4. Do NOT mention heuristics or chain-of-thought.
